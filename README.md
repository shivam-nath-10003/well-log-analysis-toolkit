# Python and Subsurface Tools

This repository contains code for an engineering project focusing on subsurface data analysis and visualization using Python.

## Project Overview

The project involves utilizing Python tools for analyzing subsurface data, including well log data and geothermal power plant information.

## Data Files

The following data files are included in the repository:

- `GeothermalPowerPlants_wikipedia.csv`: Dataset containing geothermal power plant information.
- `4900722147_722147B.las`: LAS file containing well log data.
- `petro-stats.csv`: Petrophysical statistics dataset.
- `t20-lith.csv`: Lithology data file.

## Parts Overview

The project is divided into multiple parts, each focusing on different aspects of subsurface data analysis:

1. **Data Analysis**: Preprocessing and analyzing subsurface datasets.
2. **Well Log Analysis**: Loading and interpreting well log data.
3. **Petrophysical Analysis**: Analyzing petrophysical statistics.
4. **Lithology Analysis**: Analyzing lithology data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in each part's directory.
4. Refer to the README files in each directory for detailed instructions on running the code.
