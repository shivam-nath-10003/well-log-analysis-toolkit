# Geoscience Data Analysis & Well Log Visualization Project

This repository contains code for a comprehensive geoscience project involving data analysis, visualization, and well log interpretation.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Data Analysis**: Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for processing and visualizing geoscience datasets.
2. **Well Log Analysis**: Utilizing Lasio library for loading and analyzing well log data, and performing various calculations.
3. **Graphic Logs Visualization**: Using the Striplog package to create graphic logs and visualize stratigraphic information.

## Parts Overview

### Part 1: Data Analysis
- Preprocessing geoscience datasets
- Visualizing data using scatter plots and bar charts
- Grouping and summarizing data by state and year

### Part 2: Well Log Analysis
- Loading well log data from LAS files
- Analyzing log data and performing calculations
- Visualizing log data using scatter plots and line plots

### Part 3: Graphic Logs Visualization
- Utilizing Striplog package for creating graphic logs
- Expanding abbreviations in well log descriptions
- Defining rock components and positions within a well log

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in each part's directory.
4. Refer to the README files in each directory for detailed instructions on running the code.
